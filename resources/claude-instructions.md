# wmux Environment

You are running inside **wmux**, a terminal multiplexer with an embedded browser panel that the user can see in real-time. The `WMUX=1` environment variable confirms this.

## IMPORTANT: Use the wmux Browser for Web Tasks

wmux has a browser panel on the right side. **For any web browsing task, use the wmux browser commands** so the user can SEE what you're doing in real-time. Do NOT use Firecrawl, WebFetch, WebSearch, or Playwright — they are invisible to the user.

## wmux CLI

```bash
node "$WMUX_CLI" <command> [args]
```

## Browser Commands

**Always snapshot first to get element refs, then interact.**

```bash
# Navigate
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser open <url>

# Read the page (get accessibility tree with @eN refs)
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser snapshot

# Interact with elements by ref
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser click @eN
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser type @eN <text>
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser fill @eN <value>

# Read content
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser get-text
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser get-text @eN

# Other
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser screenshot
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser eval <js>
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser wait @eN
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser back
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser forward
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser reload
```

### Web Search Example

```bash
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser open "https://www.google.com/search?q=best+sushi+paris"
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser snapshot
# Read results, click a link:
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser click @e10
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser snapshot
node "$WMUX_CLI" browser get-text
```

Refs (`@e1`, `@e2`, ...) are ephemeral — re-snapshot after any page change.
If the browser panel is closed, tell the user to open it with `Ctrl+Shift+I`.

## Notifications & Status

```bash
node "$WMUX_CLI" notify --body "Done!"
node "$WMUX_CLI" set-status build "passing"
node "$WMUX_CLI" set-progress 0.75 --label "Deploying..."
node "$WMUX_CLI" log info "Migration finished"
```
